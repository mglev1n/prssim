# Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among First-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among first-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

#' Estimate Prevalence of Elevated Polygenic Risk Among First-Degree Relatives
#'
#' This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among first-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).
#'
#' @param q (numeric; range = 0 to 1) Top quantile of risk used to define "elevated" risk in the proband. For example, if interested in the top 1% of risk, q = 0.01.
#'
#' @return (numeric) Prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among first-degree relatives

risk_sib_high_prs <- function(q) {
  checkmate::assert_number(q, lower = 0, upper = 1)

  integrand <- function(t) {
    return(dnorm(t) * pnorm(qnorm(1 - q) * sqrt(2) - t, lower.tail = F)^2 / q)
  }
  return(integrate(integrand, -Inf, Inf)$value)
}
```

<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->

Here, we define elevated risk in probands as the top 25% of the PRS distribution. We can calculate the prevalence of elevated risk in first-degree relatives:
```{r examples-sib_risk}
risk_sib_high_prs(q = 0.25)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->

```{r tests-sib_risk}
test_that("risk_sib_high_prs works", {
  expect_type(risk_sib_high_prs(0.25), "double")
  expect_error(risk_sib_high_prs(2))
  expect_error(risk_sib_high_prs(q = "a"))
})
```


# Estimate Prevalence of Disease Among First-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of disease among first-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution), based on a disease with population prevalence `K`, and proportion of variability (r^2^) explained by the PRS `r`.

```{r function-risk_sib_affected}

#'
#' @param q (numeric; range = 0 to 1) Top quantile of risk used to define "elevated" risk in the proband. For example, if interested in the top 1% of risk, q = 0.01.

  zq <- qnorm(1 - q)

# Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among Relatives of d-degree

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among `d`-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).

```{r function-risk_rel_high_prs}
#' Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among Relatives of d-degree
#'
#' This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among `d`-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).
#'

#' @param d (integer) Degree of relationship to relatives
#'
#' @return (numeric) Prevalence of elevated polygenic risk (top `q` of the PRS distribution) among relatives of `d`-degree
#'
#' @export

risk_rel_high_prs <- function(q, d) {
  checkmate::assert_number(q, lower = 0, upper = 1)
  checkmate::assert_number(d, lower = 0)
  zq <- qnorm(1 - q)
  e <- 2^d
  integrand <- function(t) {
    return(dnorm(t) * pnorm((2^d * zq - t) / sqrt(2^(2 * d) - 1), lower.tail = F) / q)
  }
  return(integrate(integrand, zq, Inf)$value)
}
```

Here, we estimate the prevalence of elevated PRS among first-degree relatives of probands in the top 10% of the PRS distribution:
  
```{r example-risk_rel_high_prs}
risk_rel_high_prs(q = 0.1, d = 1)
```
  
```{r tests-risk_rel_high_prs}
test_that("risk_rel_high_prs works", {
  expect_type(risk_rel_high_prs(q = 0.1, d = 2), "double")
  expect_error(risk_rel_high_prs(q = 0.1, d = -1))
  expect_error(risk_rel_high_prs(q = -1, d = 0))
})
```
  
# Estimate Prevalence of Disease Among d-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of disease among `d`-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution), based on a disease with population prevalence `K`, and proportion of variability (r^2^) explained by the PRS `r2`.
    
```{r function-risk_rel_affected}
#' Estimate Prevalence of Disease Among d-Degree Relatives

risk_rel_affected <- function(q, K, r2, d) {
  checkmate::assert_number(q, lower = 0, upper = 1)
  checkmate::assert_number(K, lower = 0, upper = 1)
  checkmate::assert_number(r2, lower = 0, upper = 1)
  checkmate::assert_numeric(d, lower = 0)

  r <- sqrt(r2)
  zq <- qnorm(1 - q)
  zK <- qnorm(1 - K)
  integrand_inner <- function(tp, t) {
    arg1 <- (zK - r * sqrt(1 - 2^(-2 * d)) * tp) / sqrt(1 - r^2)
    arg2 <- tp - t / sqrt(2^(2 * d) - 1)
    return(pnorm(arg1, lower.tail = F) * dnorm(arg2))
  }
  integrand_outer <- function(ts) {
    y <- numeric(length(ts))
    for (i in seq_along(ts))
    {
      t <- ts[i]
      inner <- integrate(integrand_inner, -Inf, Inf, t)$value
      y[i] <- dnorm(t) * inner / q
    }
    return(y)
  }
  return(integrate(integrand_outer, zq, Inf)$value)
}
```

Here, we estimate the prevalence of diseaes among first-degree relatives of probands in the top 25% of a PRS distribution, with a disease prevalence of 5% and r^2^ of the PRS of 0.02:
  
```{r example-risk_rel_affected}
risk_rel_affected(q = 0.25, d = 1, r2 = 0.02, K = 0.05)
```
  
```{r tests-risk_rel_affected}
test_that("risk_rel_affected works", {
  expect_type(risk_rel_affected(q = 0.25, d = 1, r2 = 0.02, K = 0.05), "double")
  expect_error(risk_rel_affected(q = 0.25, d = 1, r2 = 0.02, K = -0.05))
  expect_error(risk_rel_affected(q = 10.25, d = 1, r2 = 0.02, K = 0.05))
})
```
