# Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among First-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among first-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->

Here, we define elevated risk in probands as the top 25% of the PRS distribution. We can calculate the prevalence of elevated risk in first-degree relatives:

```{r examples-sib_risk}
risk_sib_high_prs(q = 0.25)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->


# Estimate Prevalence of Disease Among First-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of disease among first-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution), based on a disease with population prevalence `K`, and proportion of variability (r^2^) explained by the PRS `r`.


  
  
Here, we estimate disease prevalance among first-degree relatives of a proband in the top 1% of a PRS distribution, with an r^2^ of the PRS of 0.1 and disease prevalence of 5%.


```{r example-risk_sib_affected}
risk_sib_affected(q = 0.01, K = 0.05, r = 0.1)
```

  

  


# Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among Relatives of d-degree

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of elevated polygenic risk among `d`-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution).


Here, we estimate the prevalence of elevated PRS among first-degree relatives of probands in the top 10% of the PRS distribution:
  

```{r example-risk_rel_high_prs}
risk_rel_high_prs(q = 0.1, d = 1)
```

  

  

# Estimate Prevalence of Disease Among d-Degree Relatives

This function enables the user to estimate the prevalence of disease among `d`-degree relatives of probands with elevated polygenic risk (within the top `q` of the PRS distribution), based on a disease with population prevalence `K`, and proportion of variability (r^2^) explained by the PRS `r2`.
    

Here, we estimate the prevalence of diseaes among first-degree relatives of probands in the top 25% of a PRS distribution, with a disease prevalence of 5% and r^2^ of the PRS of 0.02:
  

```{r example-risk_rel_affected}
risk_rel_affected(q = 0.25, d = 1, r2 = 0.02, K = 0.05)
```
