# Estimate Prevalence of Elevated PRS Among First-Degree Relatives

This function allows us to estimate the prevalence of elevated PRS among first-degree relatives of probands.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->


<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->

Here, we define elevated risk in probands as the top 25% of the PRS distribution. We can calculate the prevalence of elevated risk in first-degree relatives:

```{r examples-sib_risk}
risk_sib_high_prs(q = .25)
```

<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->


<!-- 

# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->



<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
