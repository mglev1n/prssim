The goal of prssim is to provide a set of functions to estimate
prevalence of disease and elevated polygenic risk among relatives of a
proband with an elevated polygenic risk score. Functions are adapted
from:

> Cascade screening following a polygenic risk score test: what is the
> risk of a relative conditional on a high score of a proband? Shai
